#Layers in the OSI Model

>##physical Layer
> - moving individual bits from on (node) to the next
> - Physical characteristics of interfaces and media
> - Representation of bits
> - Data rate(transmissionrate).
> - Synchronization of bits
>   : the sender and the receiver clocks must be synchronized.
> - Line configuration
> - Physical topology
>   : how devices are connected to make a network.
>   : mesh topoloby, star topology, ring topology, bus topology
> - Transmission mode
>   : simplex, half-duplex, or full-duplex.
